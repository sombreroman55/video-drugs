# Video Drugs
Supposedly, the developers of EarthBound referred to the battle backgrounds in the game as "video 
drugs", given their colorful and "trippy" nature. This repository attempts to recreate some of those
effects, and perhaps some of the backgrounds, though not necessarily, by emulating the rendering
process of SNES backgrounds along with the different effects applied to those backgrounds by the
EarthBound developers.

## Dependencies
This project uses SDL2 for rendering and handling keyboard input.

## Screenshots
Below are screenshots of the program in action... or at least there will be once it's working.
